#heka

To say it with an analogy, heka is to OsiriX/Horos what Thorium is to Chrome.

OsiriX is the masterpiece of Antoine Rosset for medical imaging viewing.  Went from opensource to closed one. Remained almost unchanged, or at least without transcendant upgrades for years.  The licensing by subscriptions imposed now is a pain in the ass. 

In the last open source code published, there is a lot of distracci√≥n code to be cleaned up. After doing so, we well improve the product at its core thanks to a new tecnology, DCKV,  designed to work with huge studies and IA. This will be a transcendant upgrade.
